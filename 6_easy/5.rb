# Reversed Arrays (Part 2)
# https://launchschool.com/exercises/577016f3

# Write a method that takes an Array, and returns a new Array with the elements of the original list in reverse order. Do not modify the original list.

#You may not use Array#reverse or Array#reverse!, nor may you use the method you wrote in the previous exercise.

def reverse(array)
    array.each_with_index.map do |value, index|
        array[array.count-index-1]
    end
end

p reverse([1,2,3,4]) == [4,3,2,1]          # => true
p reverse(%w(a b e d c)) == %w(c d e b a)  # => true
p reverse(['abc']) == ['abc']              # => true
p reverse([]) == []                        # => true

p list = [1, 3, 2]                      # => [1, 3, 2]
p new_list = reverse(list)              # => [2, 3, 1]
p list.object_id != new_list.object_id  # => true
p list == [1, 3, 2]                     # => true
p new_list == [2, 3, 1]                 # => true
