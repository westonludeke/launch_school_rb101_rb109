# Madlibs

# Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

# Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

puts "Enter a noun:"
noun = gets.chomp

puts "Enter a verb:"
verb = gets.chomp

puts "Enter an adjective:"
adjective = gets.chomp

puts "Enter an adverb:"
adverb = gets.chomp

puts "One day you will become famous because you #{verb} your #{adjective} #{noun} #{adverb}"
